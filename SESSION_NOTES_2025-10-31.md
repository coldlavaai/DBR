# Session Notes: DBR Dashboard Multi-Dataset Attempt & Revert
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Session Goal:** Add CSV upload functionality to create multiple campaign dashboards
**Outcome:** Reverted to original state - will rebuild from scratch in new session

---

## What We Were Trying To Achieve

### User's Vision
Build a system where:
1. User can upload a CSV of leads from any campaign
2. System auto-generates a new dashboard for that campaign
3. Each campaign/dataset has its own separate dashboard view
4. Can easily switch between campaign dashboards via tabs/navigation
5. Original dashboard with existing 971 leads remains intact and working
6. All dashboards share same analytics, sections, and functionality

### Why This Is Needed
- Greenstar Solar runs multiple lead generation campaigns
- Each campaign needs separate tracking and management
- Want to analyze performance per campaign
- Need to keep campaigns isolated but use same tooling
- Current dashboard only handles one monolithic dataset

---

## What We Actually Did (Chronological)

### Phase 1: CSV Upload Implementation (Commits 4b67a14 → a331dd4)

**Added:**
1. **`components/DatasetUpload.tsx`** - Multi-step CSV upload wizard
   - File upload with drag & drop
   - Column mapping interface (smart detection of required fields)
   - Preview of data before import
   - Creates new dataset + imports leads in one operation

2. **`sanity/schemas/dataset.ts`** - New document type
   ```typescript
   {
     _type: 'dataset',
     name: string,              // "Campaign Oct 2025"
     slug: slug,
     description: string,
     totalLeads: number,
     isDefault: boolean,
     isArchived: boolean,
     color: string,             // For UI theming
     createdAt: datetime,
     importSource: {
       fileName: string,
       importedAt: datetime,
       importedBy: string
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Modified `sanity/schemas/dbrLead.ts`**
   - Added `datasetId` reference field pointing to dataset
   - This links each lead to a specific campaign

4. **API Routes:**
   - `/api/datasets` - List all datasets
   - `/api/datasets/[id]` - Get dataset by ID
   - `/api/datasets/upload` - Upload CSV and create dataset + leads

**Problem Discovered:**
- CSV parser broke on multi-line fields (conversation history column)
- Used simple `.split(',')` which treated newlines as row breaks
- **Fix:** Installed `papaparse` library (RFC 4180 compliant)

### Phase 2: UI Navigation (Commit 180d842)

**User Feedback:**
> "I hate the white tab at the bottom. I want it to be a slide-out on the side, not a white tab on the bottom to flick between the dashboards."

**Added:**
- **`components/DatasetSidebar.tsx`** - Slide-out sidebar navigation
  - Toggle button fixed on left side
  - Dataset list with lead counts
  - View mode switcher (Analytics vs Data Grid)
  - Upload new dataset button
  - Clean gradient styling matching brand

**Replaced:** Bottom white tabs with slide-out sidebar (user preferred this)

### Phase 3: Data Grid View (Commit e675155)

**User Request:**
> "When I've clicked the data grid, it doesn't switch to show me the data grid at all."

**Added:**
- **`components/DataGridView.tsx`** - Excel-style table view
  - Sortable columns (click header to sort)
  - Search by name, phone, email
  - Filter by contact status
  - Shows: Name, Phone, Email, Postcode, Status, Messages, Last Reply
  - Pagination support

**Modified `components/EnhancedDbrDashboard.tsx`:**
- Added view mode state: `'analytics' | 'data-grid'`
- Conditional rendering based on view mode
- Dataset indicator banner showing current dataset

### Phase 4: Migration Attempt (Commits e675155 → 4c984de)

**The Critical Problem:**
Original 971 leads had NO `datasetId` field. When we added dataset filtering to APIs, they became invisible.

**User Saw:**
- Dashboard showing 0 leads for "Original Dataset"
- All metrics at zero
- Conversation history missing

**Migration Strategy:**
Created `scripts/create-default-dataset.mjs`:
1. Create "Original Dataset" document in Sanity
2. Find all leads without `datasetId`
3. Assign them to "Original Dataset" in batches

**What Failed:**
- Migration script claimed success but **only 5 of 971 leads were actually updated**
- Sanity batch transactions were timing out or hitting rate limits
- Silent failures - no error messages, but writes didn't persist
- Multiple retry attempts with different batch sizes (100 → 50) all failed

**Diagnostic Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/find-missing-leads.mjs` - Check lead distribution
- `scripts/diagnose-query.mjs` - Test different query filters
- `scripts/check-manual-mode.mjs` - Check why leads weren't showing

**Discovery:**
```
Total leads: 1937
├─ 966 leads in TESTING dataset (from CSV upload)
├─ 966 leads with NO dataset (original leads, unmigrated)
└─ 5 leads in Original Dataset (failed partial migration)
```

### Phase 5: User Frustration & Decision to Revert

**User's Feedback:**
> "No, the original data set's just gone. I don't understand why it's so difficult. Surely it should just be able to be mapped from the existing database. Come on. Sort this out. This is a basic problem. Come on."

Then later:
> "Okay, well forget it. Instead of this, why not? Why don't we just keep the original data set with the feed and setup that it is, and we'll work on the rest until we're happy, and then we can change it."

**Final Decision:**
> "I've decided that this is getting too complicated. So I want you to take it back to before we included the upload. Make notes about how we did, but I want you to take this dashboard back to exactly how it was before we did any file uploads, any multiple dashboards."

## Why It Failed (Root Cause Analysis)

### 1. **Architectural Mistake: Retrofit vs Rebuild**
- Tried to retrofit multi-dataset support onto existing production system
- Existing leads had no dataset concept
- Migration script to backfill dataset references failed silently
- Breaking change to API (required `datasetId`) broke existing functionality

### 2. **Sanity Transaction Limitations**
- Batch transactions on 900+ documents failed without clear errors
- Rate limiting or timeout issues not properly surfaced
- No way to verify write success in real-time
- Transaction rollback behavior unclear

### 3. **Silent Failures Cascade**
- Migration appeared successful (exit code 0, success messages)
- Actual database state didn't match claimed state
- Led to confusion about what was actually wrong
- Had to build diagnostic scripts to understand reality

### 4. **API Design Flaw**
- Made `datasetId` required in API filters
- This broke backward compatibility
- Original 966 leads became invisible to dashboard
- Should have made filtering optional from day one

---

## What We Learned (Keep For Rebuild)

### ✅ UI/UX Components That Worked Well

1. **Slide-out Sidebar** (`DatasetSidebar.tsx`)
   - User loved this vs bottom tabs
   - Clean, professional appearance
   - Easy dataset switching
   - **Reuse in rebuild**

2. **CSV Upload Wizard** (`DatasetUpload.tsx`)
   - Column mapping worked great
   - Smart detection of required fields
   - Preview before import was helpful
   - **Reuse with modifications**

3. **Data Grid View** (`DataGridView.tsx`)
   - Excel-style table was useful
   - Sorting, filtering, search worked well
   - **Reuse as-is**

4. **Dataset Indicator Banner**
   - Clear visual showing active dataset
   - Gradient styling matched brand
   - **Reuse design**

5. **papaparse Library**
   - Handled complex CSVs correctly (multi-line fields, quoted strings)
   - RFC 4180 compliant
   - **Must use for CSV parsing**

### ❌ Technical Approaches That Failed

1. **Retrofitting onto production system**
   - Don't modify existing document types in production
   - Don't add required fields to existing data
   - Build new, migrate carefully, then switch

2. **Sanity Batch Transactions at Scale**
   - Batch size of 50 still failed on 900+ documents
   - Silent failures without clear error messages
   - Need better error handling and verification

3. **Required API Filtering**
   - Making `datasetId` required broke backward compatibility
   - Should be optional with sensible defaults
   - Default = show all leads (preserve original behavior)

4. **Migration Without Testing**
   - Deployed migration directly to production
   - Should test on small dataset first (10-50 leads)
   - Verify writes with separate fetch queries
   - Run in staging environment first

## User's Requirements For Next Session

### What User Wants To Do:

> "Once this is completed, I'm going to close this window. I'm going to open a new one. But what I want you to do is make full notes right up to this last message about exactly what we've been doing, why we've been doing it."

> "I'm going to start again, and I'm going to ask you to do an analysis of the current system. Ask me as many questions as you need."

> "Before we do anything, I want to plan the best way to make what is in my mind work in the most effective way. Structure, not Sanity, I really want to think again from first principles, thinking."

### Approach For Next Session:

1. **START WITH QUESTIONS**
   - Don't code anything immediately
   - Ask user detailed questions about requirements
   - Understand the full vision before designing

2. **THINK FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES**
   - What's the simplest data model?
   - What's the right database structure?
   - How should APIs be designed?
   - What's the migration path?

3. **PLAN BEFORE BUILDING**
   - Design complete architecture
   - Get user approval on design
   - Plan migration strategy
   - Test in staging first

4. **DON'T RETROFIT**
   - Build new system alongside old one
   - Test thoroughly before switching
   - Have rollback plan
   - Preserve existing functionality

---

## Questions To Ask User In Next Session

### Business Requirements:
1. How many campaigns do you run simultaneously?
2. Do campaigns share leads or are they always unique?
3. Should leads be able to move between campaigns?
4. What happens to old campaigns - archive or delete?
5. Do you need cross-campaign analytics (compare campaigns)?
6. Is there a "master" view of ALL leads across campaigns?

### Data Model:
1. Should each campaign be completely isolated or can they reference shared data?
2. Do you want to import the same lead to multiple campaigns?
3. When you upload a CSV, should it check for duplicate phone numbers?
4. Should conversation history stay with the lead if moved between campaigns?

### Workflow:
1. Do you create campaigns manually or via CSV upload only?
2. Should there be a campaign management page?
3. Who has permission to create/delete campaigns?
4. Do campaigns have a lifecycle (draft → active → archived)?

### Technical:
1. Should we build this as a separate app or integrate into existing dashboard?
2. Is Google Sheets sync campaign-specific or global?
3. Should Sophie AI work across all campaigns or per-campaign?
4. Do you want campaign-specific settings (different message templates, etc.)?

### Migration:
1. Should existing 971 leads become "Default Campaign" or "Original Dataset"?
2. Do you want to keep historical data or clean start?
3. Is there a maintenance window for database migration?
4. Should we test on a copy first?

## Technical Architecture Recommendations (For Next Session)

### Option A: Separate App (Recommended)
```
/dashboard              → Original dashboard (971 leads, unchanged)
/campaigns              → Campaign management (list, create, archive)
/campaigns/[id]         → Campaign-specific dashboard (copy of original)
/campaigns/[id]/upload  → Upload CSV to specific campaign
```

**Pros:**
- Zero risk to existing dashboard
- Can test thoroughly before user switches
- Easy rollback if issues
- Original dashboard always works

**Cons:**
- More code duplication
- Two separate codebases to maintain

### Option B: Unified System (Higher Risk)
Build multi-campaign support into existing dashboard from scratch:
- Design proper data model first
- Migrate existing leads as final step
- Make everything optional/backward compatible

**Pros:**
- Single codebase
- Cleaner long-term architecture

**Cons:**
- Must get it right first time
- Migration risk
- Harder to rollback

### Option C: Hybrid (Safest)
1. Build separate campaign app in `/campaigns`
2. Test with new campaigns only
3. Once proven, migrate original 971 leads
4. Redirect `/dashboard` to `/campaigns/default`

**Pros:**
- Safest approach
- Can test in production without risk
- Easy rollback
- Learn from real usage before migration

**Cons:**
- Most work upfront
- Two systems running temporarily

## Success Criteria For Rebuild

The rebuild will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ User can upload CSV and auto-create new campaign dashboard
2. ✅ Each campaign has its own isolated view
3. ✅ Easy navigation between campaign dashboards
4. ✅ Original 971 leads remain working throughout
5. ✅ All conversation history preserved
6. ✅ Google Sheets sync still works
7. ✅ Sophie HQ integration still works
8. ✅ Can export data per-campaign
9. ✅ Campaign management interface (create, archive, delete)

---

## Important: Don't Repeat These Mistakes

1. ❌ Don't modify production data structure without migration plan
2. ❌ Don't trust Sanity batch transactions without verification
3. ❌ Don't make API changes that break backward compatibility
4. ❌ Don't deploy to production without testing on small dataset
5. ❌ Don't retrofit complex features onto existing system
6. ❌ Don't code before fully understanding requirements
7. ❌ Don't ignore silent failures
