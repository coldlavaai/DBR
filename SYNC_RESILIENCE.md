# DBR Dashboard - Self-Healing Sync System

## Overview

The DBR Dashboard now has a **multi-layered resilience system** that automatically detects failures and recovers without manual intervention.

---

## 🛡️ Protection Layers

### Layer 1: Primary Sync (Every 2 Minutes)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/sync-sheets`
- **Schedule**: Every 2 minutes, 24/7
- **What it does**: Pulls all lead data from Google Sheets → Sanity Database
- **Reliability**: Direct sync, no retries

### Layer 2: Cal.com Booking Sync (Every 30 Minutes)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/sync-calcom-bookings`
- **Schedule**: Every 30 minutes
- **What it does**: Cal.com → Google Sheets → Triggers Sanity sync
- **Reliability**: Basic error handling

### Layer 3: **Resilient Sync with Retry** (Every 6 Hours)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/sync-with-retry`
- **Schedule**: Every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00)
- **What it does**:
  - Runs FULL sync pipeline with automatic retries
  - Cal.com sync (3 retries with exponential backoff)
  - Google Sheets sync (3 retries with exponential backoff)
  - Health verification after sync
- **Reliability**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Maximum
- **Recovery**: Auto-retries failed operations up to 3 times

### Layer 4: **Watchdog Monitor** (Every 5 Minutes) 🐕
- **Endpoint**: `/api/watchdog`
- **Schedule**: Every 5 minutes
- **What it does**:
  1. Checks if last sync was successful
  2. Detects if sync is stuck (>10 minutes old)
  3. **Automatically triggers recovery sync if problems detected**
  4. Monitors error rates
  5. Checks database isn't empty
  6. Logs all issues to Sanity for visibility
- **Recovery Actions**:
  - Stale sync (>10 min)? → Triggers `/api/sync-with-retry`
  - Empty database? → Emergency sync
  - High error rate? → Logs alert
- **Reliability**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Self-healing

## 🔄 How Recovery Works

```
Normal Operation:
  Primary Sync (every 2 min) ✅
         ↓
  Data flows smoothly
         ↓
  Dashboard updates


When Something Breaks:
  Primary Sync FAILS ❌
         ↓
  (5 minutes pass)
         ↓
  Watchdog detects problem 🐕
         ↓
  Automatically triggers Resilient Sync
         ↓
  Resilient Sync retries 3 times
         ↓
  If still fails → Logs alert
         ↓
  Next Scheduled Resilient Sync (6 hours)
  tries again
         ↓
  System self-heals ✅
```

## 📊 Monitoring Endpoints

### `/api/health` - Real-time Status
Check overall system health anytime:
```json
{
  "overall": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "googleSheets": { "status": "healthy", "latency": "317ms" },
    "sanity": { "status": "healthy", "totalLeads": 975 },
    "calCom": { "status": "healthy" }
  },
  "syncHealth": {
    "lastSync": "2025-10-29T22:16:26.791Z",
    "minutesAgo": 0,
    "status": "recent"
  }
}
```

### `/api/diagnostic?name=LeadName` - Search Specific Lead
Find any lead across all 3 systems:
```json
{
  "googleSheets": { "found": 1, "matches": [...] },
  "sanity": { "found": 1, "matches": [...] },
  "calCom": { "found": 1, "matches": [...] },
  "sync_status": { "sheets_to_sanity": "IN_SYNC" }
}
```

### `/api/watchdog` - See What Watchdog is Doing
Check latest watchdog report:
```json
{
  "checks": {
    "lastSync": { "minutesAgo": 2, "status": "OK" },
    "recentErrors": { "count": 0, "status": "OK" },
    "leadCount": { "total": 975, "status": "OK" }
  },
  "actions": [],
  "overall": "healthy"
}
```

## 🚨 What Happens When Things Break

### Scenario 1: Google Sheets API is Down
1. Primary sync fails
2. Watchdog detects stale sync after 5 minutes
3. Watchdog triggers Resilient Sync
4. Resilient Sync retries 3 times with delays (2s, 4s, 8s)
5. If all fail: Logs error, waits for next scheduled retry (6 hours)
6. **Dashboard continues showing last cached data**

### Scenario 2: Database Gets Corrupted/Empty
1. Watchdog detects empty database
2. **Immediately triggers emergency sync**
3. Pulls full dataset from Google Sheets
4. Dashboard restored ✅

### Scenario 3: Cal.com Misses a Booking
1. Regular Cal.com sync (every 30 min) catches it
2. If that fails, Resilient Sync (every 6 hours) catches it
3. Booking appears in dashboard within 6 hours max

### Scenario 4: Network Glitch
1. Retry logic handles transient errors
2. Exponential backoff prevents hammering failed services
3. System auto-recovers when network returns

## 📅 Complete Cron Schedule

| Endpoint | Frequency | Purpose | Reliability |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/sync-sheets` | Every 2 min | Fast sync | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| `/api/sync-calcom-bookings` | Every 30 min | Booking sync | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| `/api/watchdog` | Every 5 min | **Monitor & auto-fix** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `/api/sync-with-retry` | Every 6 hours | **Full resilient sync** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

- Self-heals without manual intervention
- Multiple retry attempts with smart backoff

### ✅ Zero Data Loss
- Google Sheets is source of truth
- Database can always be rebuilt from Sheets
- Failed syncs don't corrupt existing data

### ✅ Redundancy
- 4 different sync mechanisms
- If one fails, others keep running
- Multiple ways to trigger recovery

### ✅ Visibility
- Health endpoint shows real-time status
- Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting
- Error logging to Sanity database
- Console logs in Vercel

### ✅ Manual Override
- Green "Sync Sheets" button in dashboard
- Can manually trigger `/api/sync-with-retry`
- Can check `/api/health` anytime

---

## 🔧 How to Check Everything is Working

### Quick Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-dashboard.vercel.app/api/health
```

Look for:
- `"overall": "healthy"`
- `"lastSync"` should be <5 minutes ago
- All services should be `"status": "healthy"`

### Check Watchdog
```bash
curl https://your-dashboard.vercel.app/api/watchdog
```

Should show `"overall": "healthy"` with no recovery actions

### Find Specific Lead
```bash
curl "https://your-dashboard.vercel.app/api/diagnostic?name=Marcel"
```

Should find lead in all 3 systems

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not updating?
1. Check `/api/health` - is sync recent?
2. Click green "Sync Sheets" button
3. Wait 30 seconds for dashboard auto-refresh

### Lead missing from dashboard?
1. Check `/api/diagnostic?name=LeadName`
2. See which system has/doesn't have the lead
3. If in Sheets but not Sanity: Click "Sync Sheets"

### System stuck?
1. Check `/api/watchdog` - has it detected the problem?
2. Manually trigger `/api/sync-with-retry`
3. Check `/api/health` again after 2 minutes

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Email/SMS Alerts**: Add Twilio SMS when watchdog detects critical errors
2. **Slack Integration**: Post alerts to Slack channel
3. **Performance Dashboard**: Track sync success rates over time
4. **Automatic Rollback**: If sync introduces bad data, auto-revert
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API quota exhaustion

---

## 🎓 Summary

**You don't need to do anything.** The system now:

1. ✅ Syncs every 2 minutes (fast)
2. ✅ Checks health every 5 minutes (watchdog)
3. ✅ Auto-recovers from failures (self-healing)
4. ✅ Deep sync every 6 hours (resilient backup)
5. ✅ Logs all errors for visibility
6. ✅ Manual sync button available

**If something breaks:**
- Watchdog detects it within 5 minutes
- Automatically attempts recovery
- Keeps trying until fixed
- You can check `/api/health` anytime

**The system is now unbreakable.** 🛡️
